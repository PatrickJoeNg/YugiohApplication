A simple Program to keep track of life points.

# Overview
I made this program as a simeple project to get an understanding of UI in console, and messing around with a menu system.
It is quit messy in code, relying on if statements to loop through menus, I am quite proud of it turned out.

-Display both players current life points
-Functions to add or subtract custom amount of life points or some common choices from the game
-NEW dice roll function.
